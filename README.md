## ⚙️ Environment Setup

This project uses environment variables for sensitive data.  
Do **not** commit `.env` files.
(eg -> JWT_KEY.....REDIS_PASS....CLODINARY_KEYS.....GEMINI_API_KEY.....JUDGE0_KEY)


### 🔧 Redis Configuration
The Redis client is configured using environment variables for security:

**This is for redis.js in config folder(use .env for all these parts)**
**
username: process.env.REDIS_USERNAME,
password: process.env.REDIS_PASS,
socket: {
    host: process.env.REDIS_HOST,
    port: process.env.REDIS_PORT
}
**
